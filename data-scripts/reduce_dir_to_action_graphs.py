"""
Traverses a directory structure of Y'20 style recipe graphs and runs the reduce_graph module on all files generating action (or fat) graphs. All files are expected to be in CoNLL-U format, specifying tags in the 5th column. The tags will be changed s.t. all labels starting with 'A' are changed into 'A' and all other labels are changed into O. For the action tags with 'A', BIOUL tags will also be changed into IOB2 tags, i.e. U will be changed into B, and L will be changed into I. Paths between actions in the recipe graph become edges in the action graph.
